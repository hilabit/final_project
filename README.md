# My traveling site

This was my final project at SPICED <br />
I had one week to work on it, including coming up with an idea for it



# Features:

:sunny: I used Triposo traveling API to retrieve data a user requires in real time

:sunny: I used cookies to encapsulate data

:sunny: I used handlebars to show data in separate pages

:sunny: I used Express.js for server-side management
