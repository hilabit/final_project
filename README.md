# My traveling site

This was my final project at SPICED <br />
I had one week to work on it, including coming up with an idea for it <br />
I decided to dedicate the final week of the ever so intensive past three months to the one thing I want to do. TRAVEL. <br />
The app is a simple way of getting real time information on the city you're in. At the moment you can choose 6 cities and 3 types of info: Things to do, Info about the city or Events in your area.



# Features:

:sunny: I used Triposo traveling API to retrieve data a user requires in real time

:sunny: I used cookies to encapsulate data

:sunny: I used handlebars to show data in separate pages

:sunny: I used Express.js for server-side management
